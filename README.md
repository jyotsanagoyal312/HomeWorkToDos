### Technologies:

.Net Core 3.1, EF Core, GraphQL (including playground), Swagger (documentation)


### Pre Requisite:

Microsoft dot net core 3.1 sdk package/ dot net core runtime 3.1 version should be installed on machine.

### Logging
Logs are stored in HomeWorkToDos-{date}.txt file in the Logs folder in the executing directory.

All the request, response and error details are logged in this file.


### Database Setup

    "ConnectionStrings": 
		{
			"Default": <update-connectionString>
		}

The database contains one user already registered; username=jyotsana, password=123


### Running the Project
Go to the solution folder in `cmd` and run `dotnet restore`.

Go to the HomeWorkToDos.API folder in `cmd` and run `dotnet run`.

The APIs are accessible only by an authenticated user and required an authentication token generated by validating user login.

##### Swagger
Go to `localhost:5000` in browser to access Swagger documentation.

Add authorization token in swagger by using user login call `/api/v1/todo/User/Login` with the sample request body with the username and password.
This call will result in Jwt token in response.

Use this token to as Authentication token in the `Authorize` section of the swagger UI and enter the token in `Bearer <copied token>` format.

##### GraphQL
Go to `localhost:5000\playground` in browser to access GraphQL playground.
Use the below mutation to get the JWT.

    mutation {
    	AuthenticateUser(userName:"jyotsana",password: "123")
    }
Copy the token and add an Authorization header in the Headers section for all the requests.

    {
    	"Authorization": <copied token>
    }
